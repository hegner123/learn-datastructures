## Adjustment Guidelines

### If Ahead of Schedule
- Add more advanced problems
- Explore structure variants and optimizations
- Tackle real-world system design challenges

### If Behind Schedule
- Focus on core concepts over advanced problems
- Extend timeframes but maintain daily consistency
- Prioritize pattern recognition over implementation speed

### Difficulty Indicators
- **Too Easy**: Completing daily goals in under 2 hours consistently
- **Too Hard**: Unable to complete beginner problems within allocated time
- **Just Right**: Challenged but able to complete goals with focused effort

## Resources for Success

### Documentation Priority
1. Structure-specific .md files in each directory
2. `levels.md` for difficulty understanding
3. `standards.md` for problem format
4. `steps.md` for implementation guidance

### Practice Strategy
1. **Understand before implementing** - Theory must precede practice
2. **Implement from memory when possible** - Build recall fluency
3. **Focus on when to use, not just how to use** - Develop selection intuition
4. **Connect new structures to previously learned ones** - Build mental model
5. **Practice pattern recognition daily** - Develop instinctive problem analysis
6. **Identify edge cases and failure modes** - Understand limitations
7. **Explore implementation variants** - Recognize optimization opportunities
8. **Practice teaching explanations** - Deepen conceptual understanding
9. **Apply to cross-domain problems** - Broaden pattern recognition
10. **Recognize anti-patterns** - Avoid overengineering

The goal is not just to complete problems, but to develop the complete mastery framework: instinctive pattern recognition, memory recall, complexity analysis, edge case intuition, failure mode recognition, cross-domain application, teaching ability, real-world adaptation, and anti-pattern recognition.
