# Levels

## Intro
Comments in the solution file should provide step by step instructions in writing the datastructure.
The problem should be solvable by directly replicating the subject being tested.
Very little additional problem solving should be needed to reach a solution.
Test cases should be straight forward and shouldn't deliberately try to trip up the solution.
Provide 10 different test cases our solution should be tested against.


## Beginner
The problem should be solvable by directly replicating the subject being tested.
Very little additional problem solving should be needed to reach a solution.
Test cases should be straight forward and shouldn't deliberately try to trip up the solution.
Provide 10 different test cases our solution should be tested against.


## Intermediate
The problem should be solvable by replicating the subject matter with additional use of a single one of the previous data structures, 
using the prefix integer as a reference. 
* Example: A problem in directory 6-* could use an additional data structure from directories 1-*,2-*,3-*,4-*,or 5-*.
Moderate problem solving in addition to the subject matter should be needed to reach a solution.
Test cases should include cases that could trip up a less robust solution
Provide 10 different test cases our solution should be tested against.

## Advanced
The problem should be solvable by replicating either in full or in part the subject matter with additional use of at most three of the previous data structures, 
using the prefix integer as a reference. 
* Example: A problem in directory 6-* could use three additional data structures from directories 1-*,2-*,3-*,4-*,or 5-*.
Advanced problem solving in addition to the subject matter should be needed to reach a solution. 
Test cases should include cases that could trip up a less robust solution
Provide 10 different test cases our solution should be tested against.


## Senior
Senior level problems can only be produced into the Senior sub-directory.
The problem should be solvable by replicating either in full or in part any and/or all of the data structures.
Advanced problem solving should be needed to reach a solution. 
Test cases should include cases that could trip up a less robust solution.
Provide 10 different test cases our solution should be tested against.




## Definitions
* Subject / Subject Matter - the name of the data structure that matches the current directory name.
